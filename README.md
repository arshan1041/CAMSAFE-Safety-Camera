# CAMSAFE-Safety-Camera
Camsafe Safety Camera is a real-time AI-powered security solution that uses TensorFlow.js and the COCO-SSD model to detect people in a video feed. This project enhances surveillance and monitoring by leveraging machine learning to identify human presence and trigger alerts.

Key Features:
	•	Real-time Person Detection – Uses COCO-SSD model to identify humans in live video.
	•	Instant Alerts – Displays a red alert message on the screen when a person is detected.
	•	Alarm Sound & Vibration – Plays an alarm and triggers vibration on mobile devices for immediate attention.
	•	Web-Based Implementation – Runs directly in the browser without additional software installation.

This project aims to enhance security and safety monitoring in public and private spaces by providing immediate notifications when unauthorized persons are detected. It can be applied in home security, workplace monitoring, and smart surveillance systems.
